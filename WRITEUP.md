Analysis

Cost: App Service cheaper, auto-handles infra; VM higher cost (OS, patching, load balancer).

Scalability: App Service has built-in auto-scale; VM needs manual scale sets.

Availability: App Service has built-in HA; VM requires setup of availability sets/zones.

Workflow: App Service supports easy CI/CD; VM requires full infra management.

Choice: Azure App Service (Web App) 

Lower cost, built-in scaling & availability, easier deployment, focus on app not infra.

When Choice May Change

If app needs custom OS/runtime, high infra tuning, strict compliance, or heavy background jobs â†’ VM is better.
